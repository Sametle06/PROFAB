Use case section is designed to ease to understand how ProFAB's applications implementation and datasets importing. The instructions are available in both use case files.

- [use_case_1](use_case_1.ipynb) is to show functions to import data available in ProFAB only and some applications that are implemented via ProFAB modules.
- [use_case_2](use_case_2.ipynb) is to show functions to import datasets and applications but the difference from use_case_1, here, it is shown that how user can import his/her dataset and apply following ProFAB modules.

2 EC prediction datasets (ecNo_1-2-1-88 and ecNo_4-1) and 4 GO terms prediction datasets (GO_0000018, GO_1905523, GO_0019933, GO_0000045) are used ni guidelines.
