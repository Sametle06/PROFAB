## Description

Model learn includes machine learning alogirthms based on regression and classification.

### File Descriptions:

- **regressions.py**: It is the machine that is used to make regression on the dataset and to evalate it through some scores.Augmented machine learning algorithms are:
    - SVR(support vector machine)
    - random_forest
    - DNN(deep neural network)
    - decision_tree
    - gradient_boosting
- **classificaions.py**:  It is the machine that is used to make regression on the dataset and to evalate it through some scores.Augmented machine learning algorithms are:
    - logistic_regression
    - ridge_classifier
