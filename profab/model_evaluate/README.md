## Description

In this folder, there are machine learning, scaling and evaluation alogirthms. They are used in main() function to preprocess, predict and evaluate the data

### File Descriptions:

- **evaluation_metrics.py**: It is the module that is used apply different evaluation metrics. These are:
    - Regression:
        - mean squared error
        - root mean sqeared error
        - Pearson correlation coefficient
        - Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
    - Classification:
        - precision
        - recall
        - f1
        - f0.5
        - accuracy
        - Matthews correlation coefficient
